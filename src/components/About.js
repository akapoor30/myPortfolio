      <p>
        Passionate about problem-solving and logical thinking, I pursued a
        career in software development, enjoying its ever-evolving nature and
        the impact it has on people's lives. Outside college, I explored web
        development through online tutorials and projects, gaining confidence in
        creating web applications.
